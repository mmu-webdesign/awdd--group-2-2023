# Information Architecture (IA) & Content Strategy

## Submission Point Two

SP2 is an assessed feedback session with tutors. Use the planning document as a guide. Marks are awarded for preparedness and presentation.

The following documents should be presented. Note that they are not being finally assessed, but this is a chance to get useful formative feedback on your progress and build confidence in your ideas.

Final versions of these documents are assessed at the final submission.

- [Personas](#Personas)
- [Storyboards](#Storyboards)
- [Information Architecture Report](#Information-Architecture-Report)
- [Site Plan](#site-plan)
- [Content Delivery Schedule](#content-delivery-schedule)
- [Database Schema](#Database-schema)

## Personas

User Personas - Create 3 user personas based on the user types your research indicates you might expect to use your guide.

**One must be an international visitor to your site**. Maybe you could also include a disabled visitor but this must be based on your research, not a guess.

We prefer you to be creative and develop your own personas over using a template site. If you use a template make sure you customise the output.

### Instructions:

- Output each of your personas as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1000px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each persona image (using the code provided) in `personas.md`

> Document: [personas.md](personas.md)

_Your personas will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. They are marked at SP5._

## User Storyboards

> STORYBOARDING, a technique used in the film-making industry, is a way of conveying a story to teams and stakeholders, as well as a way to explore the best way to tell the story visually before spending a lot of money producing it. [Bryant Hodson](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-storyboard-experiences-fc051e2bc04d)

Create a simple storyboard (6 or 8 cells) for each of your personas. Illustrate how they might each interact with your guide. This could be an illustration of their touch points and interactions with your guide throughout the day, or perhaps during a term?

This will help the team think about how your users are going to use and interact with your guide.

by Rachel Krause ](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/).

Rachel also has a video - [How to Create a UX Storyboard](https://youtu.be/bNh54LNUtv8).

### Instructions:

- Create your persona on paper or digitally depending on your skills. It does not have to be 'high fidelity'.
- The above article includes a template you can print, or shows how post-its can be used in a collaborative manner.
- Add captions to each frame.
- If on paper, scan rather than photograph for better results.
- Output each of your storyboards as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1900px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each storyboard image (using the code provided) in `storyboards.md`

> Document: [storyboards.md](storyboards.md)

_Your storyboards will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. They are marked at SP5._

## Information Architecture Report

Information Architecture Report - The team must carry out and record both an **Open Card Sort** and **Tree Testing** exercises to inform your initial site architecture. This will be illustrated as a site plan.

> Card sorting is a method used to help design or evaluate the information architecture of a site. In a card sorting session, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and they may also help you label these groups. [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html).

Undertake an Open Card Sort with a number of people using paper or [Optimal Workshop Card Sort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort) (online).

Read [Card Sorting 101: Your guide to creating and running an effective card sort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting). Optimal Sort.

Once you have an architecture you like, test it out with a tree testing exercise, again on paper or using [Optimal Workshop Treejack](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack) (online) on a number of people.

Read [Tree Testing 101: Your guide to creating and running effective tree tests](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/tree-testing).

### Report

Write a short (800 words maximum) illustrated report on the process and results of both the card sort and tree testing exercises.

> Document: [ia-report.md](ia-report.md)

_Your report will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. It is marked at SP5._

## Site Plan

A site plan is an 2D illustration of your recommended architecture for the new site based on the findings of your card sorting and tree testing exercise.

You should use the format illustrated in class created in PowerPoint, use a flow chart tool like Visio, or draw with an illustration tool.

> You site plan is going to evolve over the project via a number of iterations, especially as you develop the content. Do not stray too far from the original results of your card test/tree test without testing again.

### Instructions:

- Output each of your site plan(s) as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1000px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each site plan using the code provided in `siteplan.md`
- add commentary as directed.

> Document: [siteplan.md](siteplan.md)

_Your initial site plan will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. As the project develops you can add any further iterations. They are all marked at SP5._

## Content Delivery Schedule

An essential part of the development of your site is to decide on the content of each page. As a team, you then need to decide where the content, which may include text, images, links (and metadata if you really want to get ahead), is going to come from. This means agreeing and charting what is required and who is responsible for either gathering or creating each item.

> Imaging designing a print magazine layout without knowing what content was going into the magazine. The sizes of various images? The length of various articles? A website is much the same - having the content (or some of it) before you start designing makes the process so much easier (and less guesswork).

The actual building process of your site will also be both speedier and easier if you have much of the relevant materials ready prior to the final construction phase.

> Create folders (text/media) in this repository for all the site content. Set up a procedure for proofing copy and optimising media.

You are required to use the Content Schedule template document provided.

### The Schedule

> Document: [content-delivery-schedule.xlsx](content-delivery-schedule.xlsx)

_Your content delivery schedule will be reviewed at SP2. It is marked at SP5._

> ### Best Practices for Creating Meaningful Content
>
> Some good advice from [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/content-strategy.html).
>
> We have identified these best practices to help you create meaningful and relevant content. Each piece of content should:
>
> - Reflect your organization’s goals and user’s needs. You can discover your user’s needs through conducting market research, user research, and analyzing web metrics.
> - Understand how user’s think and speak about a subject. Content should then be created and structured based on that. Doing this will also help you with search engine optimization (SEO).
> - Communicate to people in a way that they understand. Embracing plain writing principles helps with this.
> - Be useful. By being purposeful in the content that you include, omit the needless.
> - Stay up-to-date and and remain factual. When new information becomes available, update your content or archive it.
> - Be accessible to all people. You have a responsibility to make sure that all people can access and benefit from your information.
> - Be consistent. Following style guides, both for language and design, helps people understand and learn what you are trying to communicate.
> - Be able to be found. Make sure that users can find your content both through internally through navigation and also externally through search engines.
>   -Help define the requirements for the overall site. Content should drive design, structure, etc

## Database schema

Your site needs to hold some of its content in a database – news items, list of events, public artwork names and locations, local beer varieties, etc etc. You need to think about which ‘fields’ your database will need and what sort of information they would contain.

We also need you to create a sketch in code or on paper of how these database fields will be shown on the site on a ‘list page’ and a ‘detail’ page – e.g. the ‘list page’ would list all the cheeses, and the detail page would have all the information about one type of cheese – what does it look like, where can I buy it, who makes it, etc.

Add the database schema to [database-schema.md](database-schema.md).
