## TL;DR Assessment overview

- Come up with an idea that’s [relevant to the brief](the-brief.md).
- [Create these documents](portfolio.md) to document why the website you will make works the way it does and why it has the content and design you’ve added to it.
- Make a prototype of the website that looks good and works well.

## Longer Assessment overview

> **IMPORTANT -[Read the assignment overview - The brief](the-brief.md)**.

The project is broken down into 5 separate submission points. Each one is design to provide feedback on the progress of your project.

Submission Point 5 is the final submission date from which the whole project (your Guide website and this portfolio of documents) is assessed.

SP1-4 are check points to provide 'formative' feedback. Each of these are worth marks for engagement and professionalism.

Ultimately (submission point 5) you will be submitting this repository which will contain your completed Portfolio and Guide website. All the elements are listed and should be [linked from portfolio.md](portfolio.md) to make your work easier to mark. **Use the list of documents on that page as a checklist prior to submission.**

## Submission point briefings

These documents outline what you need to prepare before each submission point. You will be working on these in class. If you have any questions about these tasks, please ask us.

- [Submission Point 1](1_user_and_competitor_research/README.md) - User and Competitor research
- [Submission Point 2](2_IA_and_content_strategy/README.md) - IA and Content Strategy
- [Submission Point 3](3_design_and_prototyping/README.md) - Design and Prototyping
- [Submission Point 4](4_usability_testing/README.md) - Usability testing
- [Submission Point 5](5_QA_and_the_guide/README.md) - Acceptance testing, individual statements, and the completed Portfolio and Guide website

## Submission point marksheets

These are the marksheets we will use to create our feedback to the group - use them to prepare for each submission point: have you covered everything we will be assessing? What sort of mark do you think your work deserves?

- [SP 1 Marksheet](marksheets/sp1-marksheet.docx) - User and Competitor research
- [SP 2 Marksheet](marksheets/sp2-marksheet.docx) - IA and Content Strategy
- [SP 3 Marksheet](marksheets/sp3-marksheet.docx) - Design and Prototyping
- [SP 4 Marksheet](marksheets/sp4-marksheet.docx) - Usability testing
- [SP 5 Portfolio Marksheet](marksheets/sp5-portfolio-marksheet.docx) - The completed Portfolio
- [SP 5 Website Marksheet](marksheets/sp5-website-marksheet.docx) - The Guide (website).

## Project Management

**This is not a project which everything can be done 2 weeks before submission**. We have structured the 5 submission points to ensure that you develop the project steadily over the time provided, with plenty of time to check and approve your work before submission.

**We expect each group to manage the web development process as a team.**

- You should appoint a project manager - but do not leave managing everything to them: be proactive, and support each other.
- Be clear with each other what your strengths are, but at the same time allow people to develop their skills – enthusiasm and curiosity are important aspects of this assignment.
- Set frequent deadlines for all of the various elements of the project when relevant.
- Support each other by meeting each deadline with your personal contribution.
- Meet physically or virtually out of class time. Think about what needs to be done synchronously or asynchronously.
- Set up and agree communications channels.
- Each team member should read the instructions for each element - don't rely on the project manager alone.
- Track contributions on GiHub. If someone is failing to contribute their fair share to the group, manage this or discuss the issues with the tutors **urgently**.
- Make the most of every taught session to move the project forward.

Every team member **must** contribute to each submission point to get the marks.

## Guidelines for good Group Working

1. Everyone in the group should ensure that they can be contacted easily by other members of the group by giving them adequate contact information.

2. When working in a group, please treat other members of the group with courtesy and respect their opinions, even if you do not necessarily agree with them. Create an atmosphere where you all feel you can check and contribute to documents before submission.

3. You are expected to make a full and fair contribution to the work of the group.

4. When you agree to undertake a task that has been assigned to you by the group you must try work to the agreed deadline since failure to do so could impede the progress of the whole project.

5. You have the right, naturally, to challenge other’s opinions but please try to do it in a professional way.

6. It is your responsibility to attend all meetings arranged by the group to advance the project, and to arrive at those meetings on time. If you can’t attend a meeting of the group you should consider providing your input in written form and giving this to the other group members before the meeting.

7. If another member of your group tells you something in confidence, you should respect their wishes.
