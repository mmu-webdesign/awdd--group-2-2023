# User Research

## Summary

For this research, we conducted individual interviews with people between the ages of 18 to 30 who are living close to Manchester City Centre and studying or have studied at Manchester Metropolitan University before. There was a mixture of students who range from the creative arts to the science and technology field with a mixture of genders between the 8 profiles. The interview focused on gathering information on their lifestyle habits through their likes and dislikes whilst also gathering insight on what goals or needs they would expect from a 'How To' guide. From this we are able to assess the similar needs between multiple participants to help us agree on what 'How To' guide would best suit our stakeholders. Throughout the answers, it is clear there is a need to be cost-effective as lots of answers include the needs for 'cheap' or 'budget' food, drink and activities. A lot of profiles mention the need for having activities and places to visit with larger groups of friends that have a lively atmosphere while also keeping it cheap. Majority of the profiles live in the city centre however a few live outside so would need options that have easy accessible transports link out of the city. A few of the older profiles mention they have a need for more mature places to visit in Manchester as want to avoid the young, lively scene that university students are attracted to so our guide would need to accommodate all personality styles. During the university day, a few of the profiles mentioned it would be good to get ideas of places to go for lunch or coffee shops that have the option for workspaces and a chance to get on with assignments. Overall, the user research has given us further insight into the needs of our stakeholders for a ‘How To’ guide.
