# Ideation Report

Once the project teams had been chosen the Ideation process begun, in this Ideation process multiple techniques where used to uncover ideas and agree a solution for the project website. Firstly, the team began with a Brainstorming session, this is a technique that encourages interaction between a team to build solutions from one another’s ideas. The initial brainstorming time was used to discuss the assignment brief, align the teams understanding of the project context and come up with several possible website solutions. Next, from the initial concepts discussed the team used another technique called ‘Crazy 8’s’. ‘Crazy 8’s’ is an exercise where team members spend 8 minutes sketching out 8 different ideas with the goal to push beyond the initial ideas discussed within the brainstorming activity. The team then set off for 8 minutes creating ideas, solutions and drawings, after the 8 minutes each team member presented their ideas to the wider team individually, presenting thought process and answering any questions.

Once the ideas had been presented another brainstorming session occurred with the aim to merge ideas and agree on a final idea for the project website. The most agreed ideas where summarised and then a vote occurred to choose the solution for the project website.
