# Usability Testing

## Submission Point Four

In SP4 each team undertakes usability testing sessions, self-managed, but overseen by tutors. The output is a report capturing the issues found and an update version of your high-fidelity mock up created for SP3.

## Instructions

### About

Submission Point 4 is a chance for your team to conduct remote usability testing.

You should now have reached the stage where you have a basic design, content and structure for your `guide` web site. The group is now required to carry out usability testing and to get feedback on the success or failures of your current high fidelity prototype, so that you can incorporate this feedback into your site design.

Feedback from someone outside of your team can be invaluable to improve your work. It may highlight errors or inconsistencies; it may raise issues you had not previously noted. It might also confirm that you are doing (at least some) things right.

### How does this work?

Each team will have to record evidence of their usability testing. This may be a photograph or video of the usability test taking place, or notes taken as the test runs.

### Assessment

You will be assessed on your preparation and execution of usability testing. A tutor will support you through the process.

## The brief - User testing script

You are required to develop a method for your test session. This may be face to face or remote.

**Ensure that any Government advice on social distancing or other COVID-19 related requirements is followed.**

## Usability testing consent form

Customise the consent form (provided) for your test candidate to sign. This should include permission to record the session including video, audio and their actions on screen depending on how you design your sessions.

> Document: [consent form template document](consent_form.md). Amend as required.

After the test session create a digital version of the signed document. This will be added to your groupâ€™s [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

## (Post test) exit survey

Create a simple exit survey (5 or 6 questions) to get further feedback from your test candidate. You can use Microsoft Forms to do this.

The survey should be given to the test candidate at the end of the test session.

Use the results from the surveys as part of your report.

---

## Notes

During the test sessions you should be taking notes that you can share with the group.

> When completed, scan the notes and add to the [Usability Testing Report](usability_testing_report.md).

## Usability Testing Report

Using the template provided to develop a report on the test sessions and any further testing carried out during the project.

Any good UX report should answer the following questions:

1. What did you do?
1. Why did you do it?
1. How did you do it?
1. What did you find?
1. What are you going to do about it (ie how will it be brought back into the design/process)?

**All further testing should be detailed, evidenced (photographs) and include signed consent forms for any further test candidates**.

Always make clear any issues (support with images, screenshots etc).

Your usability testing report should collect all the data your group has found about your page design and indicate which data points need to be incorporated into the iterated page design.

Your usability testing report should then present an updated version of your page design that shows the insights you have gained from carrying out the user testing.
