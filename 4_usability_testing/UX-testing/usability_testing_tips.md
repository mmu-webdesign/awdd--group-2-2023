# Tips &amp; Advice -  Usability Testing Session

## General Feedback 
**from previous years (what they got right/wrong).**

>Overall most teams do a very good job of preparing and running their first usability testing session. 

There are alway one or two teams that clearly do not prepared enough. They regret this as soon as the session starts.

 >Here are some general comments that relate to some or all group performances.

1. Who is leading the session? You need to be engaged and prepare well for this to be successful. All of the team need to know what is happening.

2. Introductions – some times excellent; in a few cases they are non-existent. A good group introduces all of the group members.

3. Some teams forget to set the context – What is this site for? Who is it aimed at?

4. The better teams explain that &#39;this is a work in progress&#39;. Some teams did not explain the missing content or minimal design. This can confuse the test candidate.

5. Teams need to present the consent form for the user to sign.

6. The better teams settle the user into the situation, explaining that it wasn&#39;t them being tested; that any feedback, good or bad would be useful. Some teams miss out this and dive into the tasks.

7. Tasks or questions? Are you asking them something or asking them to do something?

8. Talk aloud – many teams fail to explain this. These teams therefore suffered a tester (unless they were lucky) who clicked away and revealed nothing.

9. Some teams leave the user sitting there reading. The tasks should include something like &#39;I would like you to click through to find…&#39;.

10. The better teams manage to engage the user, making them feel comfortable, getting more from them. Some sessions are very brief, with no attempt to extend the session by drawing out more on various points raised.

11. Most tasks teams select are relevant, sensible and tested the site. Some teams have extra tasks to test in more detail. One or two teams in the past had errors in their site that meant the task(s) asked was impossible.

12. It is often obvious for a number of teams that there were some serious errors with their site that need to be addressed. Even the best sites had questions raised during the testing.

13. Extra tasks. The session is often over quickly. The better teams prepare some extra tasks to best make use of the session.

14. All teams must have an exit survey. Did they provide some additional feedback? Good teams ask if there was anything else they would comment on. In the past one group had some additional questions. This included 3 best, 3 worst features, 1 thing that they would change/fix.

15. Say &#39;thank you&#39; – some teams forget to thank their test participant.
