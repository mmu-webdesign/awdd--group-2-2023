# Quality Assurance (QA) and The Guide

## Submission Point Five

> _SP5 is the final submission. Your completed `Guide` website plus this portfolio of evidence developed over all of the submission points (SP1-5)_.

## Testing the site to ensure quality

Quality assurance is essential for any finished product. In the 'real world' you don't want to be releasing a product (website) that contains errors and omissions.

As a student group, to maximise the potential for a good mark you need to:

- Ensure the project fulfils the requirements of the brief (by checking against the brief and marksheets).
- By testing the final 'live' site before submission using the tools and techniques listed below.

## QA elements

- [Accessibility audit](#Accessibility-audit)
- [Cross Browser testing](#Cross-Browser-testing)
- [Usability testing report](#Usability-testing-report)
- [Google translation testing report](#Google-translation-testing-report)

- [Individual statements](#Individual-statement)

## Accessibility audit

The WebAIM WCAG 2 checklist helps you undertake an audit of your siteâ€™s accessibility (using the accessibility guidelines).

Three documents are provided.

- Use the [WebAIM WCAG 2 checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/WCAG2Checklist.pdf) to assess your site. Print a copy and tick or cross relevant boxes, then scan.
- Use the [WebAIM WCAG 2 support document](wcag/WCAG2_checklist_support.docx) to help you understand the checklist and what is relevant to your project.
- Use the [WCAG comments document](wcag/template_WCAG2_comments.docx) to record any issues addressed and actions taken. This document provides tutors with an insight into how you have managed the audit.

### Core accessibility issues for your submission:

1.  Use of semantic elements for page structure
1.  Good colour contrast
1.  Relevant alt text for images
1.  Skip links implemented on all pages
1.  Accessible form(s)

Create a single document containing your completed checklist and comments document.

## Cross Browser testing

You must check your guide using a variety of browsers across a variety of devices to test browser compatibility. This means different browsers, versions, operating systems and screen sizes.

You all have access to a variety of operating systems on laptops, desktops, tablets and mobiles, and a variety of browsers including MS Edge, Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

**Your designs do not need to work on Internet Explorer**.

Copy the screenshots to the template provided and add comments regarding any findings, errors or corrections.

Illustrate any corrections (showing before and after) - if you've spotted an error, fix it, re-test, screenshot, comment.

## Google translation testing report

Internationalisation (`l18n`) is when we take a website and modify it for another audience speaking a different language. If your website was translated into another language, would the layout cope? Some languages have really long words: Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften (google it) for example. Do you have text 'locked away' in images that can't be translated? What happens when your browser has to show text with a different alphabet?

We would like you to run your site through Google Translate (using the chrome browser plugin) and check that a visitor from another country would be able to use your site in their language. We'd suggest German, Russian and Chinese as a start - if one of your team members can speak another language please use their expertise and test the site in their language (how good a job does google translate do?). If your site has a form, check this list of falsehoods - are you assuming anything about your users you shouldn't?

> **Note**: whilst if your team has language skills it is good to note how well the translations works, this is **not** the focus of this report. **You are looking to see if the change in language breaks your design**.

Put together a short report with screenshots (250 words) of three translated versions of the homepage and an inner page of your site, and talk about any issues you found as a result.

## Quality audit

Test for quality. This includes html validation, coding, links, seo and metadata.

Undertake a speed test using one or more of the online tools. Identify and fix any over-sized images (prime cause of slow loading).

Validate and audit your CSS (looking for unused, redundant CSS).

Validate your HTML. Review your HTML - has it maintained a strong semantic structure? Look for simple negative things, like overuse of the `<br>` tag to create space (rather than using CSS as you should).

### Tools to try

1.  [Checkbot - Chrome extension](https://www.checkbot.io)
1.  [Google Test my site](https://testmysite.withgoogle.com)
1.  [HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
1.  [CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
1.  [Squoosh for online image optimisation](https://squoosh.app/)
1.  Test the readability of your site content using the [free version of readable.com](https://readable.com/)

Develop a short report using selected screenshots to provide evidence. Discuss any issues discovered and how they were tackled.

## Future developments

A single team statement on possible ways the site could be further developed for the client in the future. This includes technical features that would require extra time or investment to develop outside of the scope of this assessment.

**Warning:** if you simply list a number of features that could have been implemented as part of your submission, then you are simply highlighting your failings as a team.

Word count: 250 words (+/- 10%)

## Final Documentation

There are three remaining elements to complete the portfolio.

### Peer assessment if required

A percentage of the assignment marks are available for peer review. A team that has worked well would elect to share the marks evenly. A team that has one or more team members who have not fully contributed to the project can agree, as a team to redistribute the marks. More will be explained in class.

### Individual statements

This is a chance to discuss how you and your colleagues managed the project, what you learnt, and your individual critique of the final product.

As this statement is personal you are not required to display this as part of the Portfolio. Each statement is submitted to an individual dropbox on Moodle.

- Word count 500 words (+/- 10%).
- Use the [template MSWord document for your individual statement](individual_statement.docx).
- Each team member must upload their individual statement the the relevant dropbox on Moodle.
- Upload as a `pdf`. Use the following format: `groupNumber-mmuID.pdf` e.g. `group1-99883344.pdf`
